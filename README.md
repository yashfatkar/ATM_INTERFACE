### Tools Used

This project was developed using the following tools and technologies:

- Python 3.6 or higher: The core programming language used for development.
- [Tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/): A Python library for formatting data into tables.
- [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html): A Python library for system-specific functions.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code): An integrated development environment (IDE) for code editing and debugging.

## Usage

1. Run the ATM interface using the steps mentioned in the Installation section.

2. Enter your User ID and PIN to log in. (For demonstration purposes, User ID: `555555`, PIN: `234567`)

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform ATM operations:

   - Deposit money: Choose option 1, enter the deposit amount, and your passcode.
   - Withdraw money: Choose option 2, enter the withdrawal amount, and your passcode.
   - Transfer money: Choose option 3, select the transfer type, and enter recipient details, amount, and your passcode.
   - Check balance: Choose option 4 and enter your passcode.
   - View transaction history: Choose option 5 and enter your passcode.
